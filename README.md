# Sports Injury Analysis
 I work on Athlete Health & Injury Dataset to help sports organizations minimize downtime, control costs, and enhance player availability through rigorous, data-backed injury management. Doctors, leagues, athletic trainers, and front-office executives - all benefit from granular injury insights to preserve competitive edge and safeguard athlete welfare.

## 📊 Project Overview  

Sports injuries impact both **athlete welfare** and **team performance**.  
This project provides:  

- 📈 Injury trends (by type, body part, cause, severity)  
- ⏳ Recovery time analysis  
- 🔄 Recurring injury tracking  
- 💰 Treatment cost breakdown  
- 💡 Data-backed recommendations
