# Sports Injury Analysis
 I work on Athlete Health & Injury Dataset to help sports organizations minimize downtime, control costs, and enhance player availability through rigorous, data-backed injury management. Doctors, leagues, athletic trainers, and front-office executives - all benefit from granular injury insights to preserve competitive edge and safeguard athlete welfare.

## Insights


### Injury Trends and Severity
#### Across Sports: Injuries are distributed fairly evenly by sport (each of 5 sports â‰ˆ3,000 injuries).For example, athletics (total 3,041), football (3,006), basketball (3,004), boxing (3,003), and tennis(2,946) each account for about one-fifth of all cases . 
#### Severity: Roughly half of all injuries are classified as minor and about one-third as moderate(based on injury counts). Severe injuries (~15%) account for the bulk of costs (68% of treatmentcosts go to severe cases suggesting that while rare, high-severity injuries drive expenses. 
#### Causes: Injuries arise from a mix of causes: falls were the single largest category (3.9K cases),while overuse, contact, and non-contact injuries are each roughly equal (~3.7K cases each) .This indicates a need to address both acute incidents (falls) and chronic stress (overuse). 
#### Seasonality: Injuries occur throughout the year; the monthly breakdown shows no singledominant peak, implying that training programs should maintain consistent injury prevention year-round.
